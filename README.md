## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- MDN references

### What I learned

This was the first time i have worked for something from scratch, I had a good experience from this project. I really enjoyed it though the css styling content was a bit hard for me(even though i had learned it previously), I think this practice will make me proud of myself. I have added the snippets that took most of my time.

```html
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="qr-code">
```
```css
body{
    font-family: "Outfit", "Arial", "sans-serif";
    background-color: #d5e1ef;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    max-width: 1440px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will mostly focus on CSS than HTML, I have so much more to learn.
